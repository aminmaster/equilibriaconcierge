# AI Implementation Guidelines

## Core Principles

1. **User-Centric Design**: The AI should always serve the user's needs and provide value
2. **Transparency**: Users should understand when they're interacting with AI
3. **Privacy**: User conversations and data must be protected
4. **Accuracy**: The AI should provide accurate, up-to-date information
5. **Safety**: Implement safeguards against harmful or inappropriate content

## Technical Implementation

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

1. **Document Ingestion**:
   - Chunk documents semantically using natural breakpoints
   - Generate embeddings using OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model
   - Store embeddings in Supabase with pgvector extension

2. **Query Processing**:
   - Embed user queries using the same model
   - Perform similarity search in the vector database
   - Retrieve top-k most relevant chunks

3. **Response Generation**:
   - Construct prompt with retrieved context
   - Call OpenRouter API with admin-configured model
   - Stream response tokens to client for real-time feedback

### Conversation Management

1. **Session Handling**:
   - Anonymous users: Store conversations with session ID
   - Authenticated users: Link conversations to user ID
   - Automatic cleanup of expired anonymous sessions

2. **Feedback System**:
   - Thumbs up/down for each AI response
   - Detailed feedback modal for suggestions
   - Edit functionality for correcting responses

### Model Configuration

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Admin-configurable text generation models
   - Support for multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
   - Temperature and other parameter controls

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Graceful degradation when primary model fails
   - Clear error messages for users
   - Logging for system administrators

## User Experience Guidelines

1. **Loading States**:
   - Skeleton loaders for content areas
   - Streaming UI for AI responses
   - Clear progress indicators for long operations

2. **Error Handling**:
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Graceful degradation when features are unavailable

3. **Accessibility**:
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast compliance
   - Responsive design for all devices

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Protection**:
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Secure storage of API keys
   - Regular security audits

2. **Content Safety**:
   - Content filtering for inappropriate inputs/outputs
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - User reporting mechanisms

3. **Compliance**:
   - GDPR compliance for user data
   - Clear privacy policy and terms of service
   - Data deletion mechanisms
